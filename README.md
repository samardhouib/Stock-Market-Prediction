# Stock-Market-Prediction
I developed a model for stock market simulation and prediction utilizing ARIMA for time series forecasting and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for deep learning. This approach allowed me to achieve high accuracy in predicting stock prices, providing valuable insights into market trends. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining traditional statistical methods with advanced deep learning techniques to enhance predictive capabilities in financial markets.
